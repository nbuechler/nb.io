# nb.io
This project will be hosted via AWS at: http://nathanielbuechler.io

The main goal is to document the work I have accomplished in my personal time, and to share that work in the public space.

# Purpose
The idea is to keep track of the motivation for a project, its API's, and other useful information for the many software projects I've created.

# Description
* Maybe one day, someone else will want to use some of my code, and I want to make it easier for them.
* Also, I want to make it easier for myself to use as a reference in the distant future.
